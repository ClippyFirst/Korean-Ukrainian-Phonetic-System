# Korean–Ukrainian Phonetic System: Research Programme

Status: research programme established; baseline repository and runtime audits substantially reconstructed; official NIKL inventory crawl remains pending.
Last updated: 2026-10-21.

This directory is the durable source of truth for research planning, evidence tracking, implementation coverage, decisions, and release acceptance. Continue work from these files rather than relying on chat history.

## Start here
1. [Master directive](MASTER-DIRECTIVE.md) — mission, principles, and working protocol.
2. [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) — staged work programme and exit criteria.
3. [Source register](SOURCE-REGISTER.csv) — source inventory and seed sources.
4. [Rule coverage matrix](RULE-COVERAGE.csv) — traceability from rules to code and tests.
5. [Source-by-source assessment](SOURCE-ASSESSMENT-2026-10-15.md) — utility, limits, and integration decisions for current and candidate sources.
6. [Source discovery queue](SOURCE-DISCOVERY-QUEUE.csv) — prioritized research backlog with risks and next actions.
7. [Literature and methods review](LITERATURE-AND-METHODS-REVIEW-2026-10-15.md) — Korean G2P research, formal rule models, neural/hybrid alternatives, Ukrainian receiving-language studies, and the required comparison protocol.
8. [Critical literature review 01](CRITICAL-LITERATURE-REVIEW-01-2026-10-16.md) — evidence memo distinguishing accessible full-text findings from abstract-only evidence, with implementation implications and remaining review tasks.
9. [Ukrainian target-layer comparison](UKRAINIAN-TARGET-LAYER-COMPARISON-2026-10-16.md) — page-referenced comparison of Shchegel (2009) and Kovalchuk (2011), including conflicts and proposed tests.
10. [Decision log](DECISION-LOG.md) — durable record of consequential decisions.
11. [Release acceptance gates](ACCEPTANCE-GATES.md) — evidence required before a release is accepted.

## Current state
The Phase 0 reconstruction is substantially complete on the current mainline, with current CI and deployment evidence recorded in the master handoff. Do not treat the programme as scientifically complete: the official NIKL source inventory has not yet been crawled by the new collector, full browser/Python morphology parity is not established, and independent IPA/Ukrainian target validation remains open.

Current evidence gaps:
- run the official NIKL collector in a network-enabled environment and reconcile all 30 article headings;
- inspect current source reuse terms before retaining or redistributing official article text;
- finish rule-level parity across browser, Python, CLI, and API where the current matrix says it is incomplete;
- obtain independent phonetic/IPA and Ukrainian target-layer review;
- retain exact-head CI and deployment smoke evidence for each release candidate.

## Working rules
- Update these files as work progresses. Every work session must leave a durable status update.
- Record exact evidence, source URLs, versions, commit SHAs, commands, and outcomes.
- Distinguish not checked, checked and absent, partially implemented, implemented, tested, and independently reviewed.
- Do not mark work complete based on documentation claims alone.
- Prefer small, reviewable changes on task-specific branches and integrate only after required checks.
- Never claim a branch was merged, a test passed, or a site was verified unless the result is recorded.
- If uncertain, record the uncertainty and next verification step.

## Status vocabulary
Use controlled statuses where possible: not_started, in_progress, blocked, source_verified, formalized, implemented, tested, runtime_verified, cross_runtime_verified, independently_reviewed, accepted, rejected, deferred.

A single item may need separate source, implementation, testing, and review statuses. Do not collapse them into one ambiguous “done” field.


## Official NIKL collection continuation — 2026-10-21

The metadata-first collector is available at `scripts/nikl-norm-crawler.mjs`; see `docs/NIKL-NORM-CRAWLER.md`. It is designed to inventory only the 30 articles of 제2부 표준 발음법, checks robots.txt, records exact response and per-article hashes, and fails closed on incomplete extraction. Fixture-based tests are part of the existing Node regression suite. No live crawl is claimed yet; source reuse terms remain unassessed, and the default output does not retain article text. See `research/SOURCE-REGISTER.csv`, `research/RULE-COVERAGE.csv`, and the latest master handoff for current status.
