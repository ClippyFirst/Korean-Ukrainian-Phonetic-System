# Master execution plan and handoff — 2026-11-08

## Execution checkpoint

This continuation executed the existing benchmark and corpus-access work rather than replacing the repository plan. The user explicitly authorized repository improvements, imports and internet research. Work remained on `main`, consistent with the existing owner preference; no branch or PR was created.

- Starting main commit: `893619785c8fc7c8417cc8da0690d84fcb8d8dbb`.
- Benchmark code snapshot: `668dbad14568e8472594937558500500102b3f95`.
- Main before final audit closure: `de1d9b10f31e4ea730fc7c5940753c42f54ab3a1` (the final audit commit follows this revision).
- Full 10-engine benchmark: [run 42487350896](https://github.com/ClippyFirst/Korean-Ukrainian-Phonetic-System/actions/runs/42487350896), artifact `13621335293`.
- Seoul corpus ingestion and two additional three-mode benchmarks: [run 42491208142](https://github.com/ClippyFirst/Korean-Ukrainian-Phonetic-System/actions/runs/42491208142), artifact `13622140135`.

## Completed work

### Benchmark execution

Five executable evaluation tracks now exist across three datasets:

1. UGTPHON — 10-engine Strict IPA and Broad sensitivity.
2. SIGMORPHON 2021 Korean — 10-engine Strict IPA and Broad sensitivity.
3. UGTPHON — Kozak Kim Browser Strict, Soft and Super-soft.
4. Seoul Corpus SLR113 — Kozak Kim three-mode Hangul surface pronunciation.
5. Seoul Corpus SLR113 — Kozak Kim three-mode phonemic IPA via a versioned 36-symbol adapter.

The five-track count is not five independent corpora. KsponSpeech and NIKL 2022 remain access/terms-gated candidates and are not scored.

### Seoul Corpus label import

- Retrieved only the 57 MB OpenSLR SLR113 label archive in CI; audio was not downloaded.
- Archive SHA-256: `63c3f8ffa6976307a732689d6c5be7b2db4ec20f14bf276faf98c886add0d24b`.
- 240/240 TextGrid files parsed; 1,680 tiers; 2,671,221 interval annotations.
- 231,626 aligned Hangul word pairs; 231,625 aligned phonemic IPA pairs.
- 36 observed phone symbols mapped using Table 3 of Yun et al. (2015), DOI `10.13064/KSSS.2015.7.2.103`.
- 1,134,781 phone intervals mapped; 70,660 non-phone/unmapped intervals excluded. Seven word intervals were excluded from phone-to-word IPA scoring (six boundary conflicts, one non-phone/unmapped label).
- Raw corpus labels, audio and pair JSON files remain temporary CI data. The CC BY-NC 2.0 corpus is not committed or uploaded.

### Mode results and interpretation

- On Seoul Hangul surface: Strict 97.0375% coverage, 57.1537% scored-only Exact, 55.4605% coverage-adjusted Exact, 24.5421% CER. Soft 87.0006% coverage / 48.8991% adjusted Exact / 26.3641% CER; Super-soft 83.4924% / 47.4662% / 26.3118%.
- On Seoul phonemic IPA: Strict 97.0375% coverage, 14.1166% scored-only Exact, 13.6984% coverage-adjusted Exact, 39.9210% CER. Soft 87.0005% / 12.8734% adjusted Exact / 40.8696% CER; Super-soft 83.4923% / 12.8402% / 40.4053%. Soft/Super-soft scored-only Exact is higher only because they score fewer source-resolved cases; strict wins every exact comparison on common scored subsets.
- The phonemic reference is not narrow phonetic gold. The mapping adapter explicitly serializes `ʨ` as `tɕ` and asterisk fortis markers as `͈`; independent Korean phonetics review remains required.
- Native/Browser Strict parity on UGTPHON: 2,703/2,703 surface outputs and 2,702/2,702 resolved raw IPA/Broad IPA outputs.
- No production pronunciation rules or lexical exceptions were promoted from Seoul Corpus.

## Existing implementation preserved

- Existing IPA-first pipeline and the Native/Browser Kozak Kim implementations.
- Original g2pK 0.9.4 vendor baseline; external engines remain comparison-only.
- Existing 236-case review queue and source-backed lexical controls; no reinterpretation of the 213 unadjudicated, 22 ABSTAIN and 1 provisional RETAIN dispositions.
- Existing five-dataset portfolio and benchmark suite register; extended in place rather than duplicated.

## Verification actually executed

Latest source-register/docs closure on `de1d9b10f31e4ea730fc7c5940753c42f54ab3a1`: tests [42491874801](https://github.com/ClippyFirst/Korean-Ukrainian-Phonetic-System/actions/runs/42491874801) **PASS** (Python 3.11/3.12/3.13, Web/npm tests/build, wheel install, teacher-corpus audit); System Verify [42491874749](https://github.com/ClippyFirst/Korean-Ukrainian-Phonetic-System/actions/runs/42491874749) **PASS**; master artifacts [42491874837](https://github.com/ClippyFirst/Korean-Ukrainian-Phonetic-System/actions/runs/42491874837) **PASS**. Source register has 230 rows and all rows parse as 12 CSV fields.\n\nNo claim is made that GitHub Pages deployment completed; it was queued at the time of the benchmark snapshot. Neural ByT5 and CharsiuG2P remained skipped under existing default-off policy. The container's direct network download attempt was unavailable; GitHub Actions successfully retrieved the public archive. No local full repository test run is claimed; CI is the verification source.

## PRs, branches and merge decisions

- Work continued directly on `main`, not on a new branch, following the established owner preference.
- No open PR was present in the repository's GitHub REST open-PR listing at inspection time.
- PR #457 had already been merged and its historical artifact was retained only as historical comparison; the exact-main run 42487350896 supersedes it for current benchmark code.
- No user branches were deleted, no PR was merged blindly, no force-push occurred, and no release was published.

## Remaining task ledger

| Task | State | Exact blocker / acceptance criterion |
|---|---|---|
| Independent review of Seoul phoneme-to-IPA adapter | **TODO** | Korean phonetics reviewer to approve Table 3 serialization choices and the phonemic-vs-phonetic comparison boundary. |
| Ukrainian target rendering validation on Seoul | **DEFERRED** | Seoul supplies Hangul and phonemic IPA references, not Ukrainian target gold. Requires separately adjudicated Ukrainian target references. |
| KsponSpeech benchmark | **BLOCKED** | AIHub account/access and original corpus terms; the Hugging Face mirror's empty license field is not permission. |
| NIKL 2022 Daily Conversation benchmark | **BLOCKED** | NIKL portal application and exact license/terms; no access token/data obtained. |
| SIGMORPHON sealed-holdout status | **PARTIAL** | Verify source split and training overlap before describing it as a sealed holdout. |
| 236-case independent linguistic adjudication | **PARTIAL** | 213 cases not individually adjudicated, 22 ABSTAIN, 1 provisional RETAIN; no promotion to gold/production. |
| Neural ByT5 / CharsiuG2P | **DEFERRED** | Existing default-off policy; requires model/runtime and data provenance review. |
| Release readiness | **NOT READY** | Independent phonetics review, Ukrainian target validation, corpus-rights review and complete holdout adjudication remain incomplete. |

## Repository status

**Software-verified research prototype; not independently research-certified and not release-ready.** The five evaluation tracks are reproducible, but the corpus references have distinct conventions, the Seoul IPA adapter is phonemic, and production acceptance still requires independent review. The final repository HEAD is the commit containing this handoff plus the subsequent audit update; see the final execution report for the exact SHA.
